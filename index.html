                    <h2>Long Island city is a historic piece of New York. Weâ€™re embracing the neighborhoodâ€™s history, and leading it into the future.</h2>
                    <p>Long Island City has a prominent place in New Yorkâ€™s history. Early settlers in this area were originally interested in the rich soil for farming. At the turn of the 20th century major traffic infrastructure delivered new opportunity for the area to host a vast supply of manufacturing business; a perfect entry point into the industrial age. During the 1970â€™s Long Island City lost a major portion of its business to world competitors. As a result, a lot of buildings in the area were abandoned and unused for decades. One of them, is a huge paper factory on the 36th street, overlooking Manhattan. Starting in the late 1990â€™s the area went through a period of gentrification where a large volume of business and cultural influence came back to Long Island City. Currently Long Island City is the most culturally and economically booming neighborhood in New York City. With area attractions like The Noguchi museum, 5 Pointz, and MoMA PS1, you will have plenty local landmarks to discover during your stay.</p>
